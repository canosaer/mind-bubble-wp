                    <p class="workshops__cancel-text">Our workshops are always 100% free - but be advised that canceling your student's registration within a week of the workshop incurs a $5 cancellation fee. Canceling within 24 hours of the workshop incurs a $10 cancellation fee. Not showing up without notifying us of cancellation in advance incurs a $20 cancellation fee. Because we never want money to be a barrier for students who wish to take advantage of our workshops, we'll cover the first $20 of cancellation fees you incur each calendar year. Cancellation fees prevent you from being able to sign up for workshops until they are paid.</p>
